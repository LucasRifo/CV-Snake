# CV-Snake
Snake game in pygame instructions.

How to run the code:
For proper execution, it is necessary to install the following libraries first:
- pygame
- cv2
- numpy
after this it is only necessary to have a camera activated and run the file "SnakeGame.py" on the terminal.

How to Play: 
1) press any letter on the keyboard to start. 
2) Take and move a green object that simulates its directions of movement (move object up so that the snake goes up, move object down so that the snake goes down, move object left so that the snake goes left and move object right so that the snake goes right).
3) Take and display a blue object for this snake to accelerate its movement.
4) you can combine the directions of motion with acceleration while these 2 objects are on screen and the green object in its desired direction.
5) if you want to remove the game press the keyboard "ESC"
